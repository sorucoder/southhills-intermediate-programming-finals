# Chapter 9

## Prompt

Playing cards are used in many computer games, including versions of such classics as Solitaire, Hearts, and Poker. Design the code for a Card class that contains a string data field to hold a suit (spades, hearts, diamonds, or clubs) and a numeric data field for a value from 1 to 13. Include get and set methods for each field. Write an application that randomly selects two playing cards and displays their values. Using two  Card objects, design an application that plays a simple version of the card game War. Deal two Cardsâ€”one for the computer and one for the player. Determine the higher card, then display a message indicating whether the cards are equal, the computer won, or the player won. (Playing cards are considered equal when they have the same value, no matter what their suit is.) For this game, assume that the Ace (value 1) is low. Make sure that the two Cards dealt are not the same Card. For example, a deck cannot contain more than one
Queen of Spades.
