Write the code for a program that continuously prompts the user for a number of dollars until the user enters 0. Pass each entered amount to a conversion method that displays a breakdown of the passed amount into the fewest bills; in other words, the method calculates the number of 20s, 10s, 5s, and 1s needed.

## Usage

Run the program:
```bash
go run main.go
```
