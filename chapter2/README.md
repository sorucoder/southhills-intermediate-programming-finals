# Chapter 2

## Prompt

Write the code for a program for Arnie’s Appliances. The program should prompt the user for a refrigerator model name and the interior height, width, and depth in inches. Calculate the refrigerator capacity in cubic feet by first multiplying the height, width, and depth to get cubic inches, and then dividing by 1728 (the number of cubic inches in a cubic foot). The program accepts model names continuously until “XXX” is entered. Use named constants where appropriate. Also use modules, including one that displays End of job after the sentinel is entered for the model name.

## Usage

Run the program:
```bash
go run main.go
```
